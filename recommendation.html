To manage arsenic contamination in rice fields, key strategies include implementing alternate wetting and drying irrigation, 
using organic soil amendments like vermicompost, selecting low-arsenic rice varieties such as Muktoshree, 
regularly testing soil and water for arsenic levels, utilizing clean water for irrigation whenever feasible, 
and adhering to national and international arsenic safety regulations in agricultural practices to safeguard public health.
