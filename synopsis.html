Rice, a crucial staple for over half of the global population, is rich in nutrients but faces contamination risks, particularly in Asian and African countries heavily reliant on it. Arsenic contamination poses significant threats to food safety and human health in rural areas. Factors such as soil arsenic concentration, pH levels, and irrigation practices influence arsenic levels in rice grains. To address this, a pioneering predictive application has been developed to estimate arsenic concentration in rice grains based on soil parameters, aiding mitigation efforts.

<p>
<b>Objective</b>:
	<ol>
		The primary objective of this application is to provide an innovative and practical solution for farmers, agricultural scientists, and environmental agencies to assess the potential arsenic contamination in rice crops. By integrating advanced predictive modelling techniques, the app aims to facilitate informed decision-making regarding soil management practices and arsenic mitigation strategies.

</p>

<p>
The app employs a sophisticated algorithm, trained on diverse datasets from arsenic-contaminated areas in West Bengal, India, to predict arsenic levels in rice grains based on soil parameters like arsenic levels, pH, organic matter, phosphorus, and iron. Users input these parameters to receive predictions tailored to their specific soil conditions.
